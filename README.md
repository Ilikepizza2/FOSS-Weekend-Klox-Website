# FOSS Weekend Klox Website

## About
This project is a simple responsive website (with dark mode ðŸ˜Ž) for a fictional brand, made using a tiny bit of vanilla JavaScript and css variables

## Local Setup
- After forking and cloning this repository to your local machine, open the project folder in your favourite code editor.
- Assuming you already have the "Live Server" extension installed (if not, then install it right now, it is very useful for any simple html css js project!), open `index.html` with Live Server.
- Any changes you make in the code will be reflected in the browser immediately

## â€¼ Important â€¼
This project aims to get you to practise CSS. It is important to understand that JavaScript is a very powerful tool, but with power comes responsibility, so we must only use it where necessary. If there is something that can be done using CSS only, then we should avoid using JavaScript in that case.

All issues in this repository can be fixed using only CSS, though there are ways of solving them using JavaScript too. 

**ANY PRs MAKING USE OF JAVASCRIPT WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. ONLY SOLVE ISSUES USING CSS.**
